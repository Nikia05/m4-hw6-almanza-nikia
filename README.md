I used multiple sites,

https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript

https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp

https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp

I also watched the lecture, however this was a difficult assignmment to understand. This is the first time learning javascript so looking up and goggling only went so far because I have trouble knowing what to search for. In this assignment I watched the lecture that helped figure out 2-3 tests, but while trying to figure out the rest it took away the completed test. I tried watching tutorials but it is something that is not processing to me. I feel what will help me with futre projects is having a one on one zoom meeting to go over the homework. Unfortuntatly I have to work every class session so I cannot participate like I would like.
